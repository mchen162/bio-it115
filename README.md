A place to store my IT115 bio info

My name is Melissa Chen. I am currently a student in the Application Development and Testing track in the Year Up program. 

Before starting the program, I worked in the customer service industry. I worked at Beach house Bar and Grill for 4 years as a hostess, expo, barback/busser, cocktailer, and server. I am a quick learner and adapted well in the restaurant while taking on different roles and responsibilities. I learned to establish professional and personal relationships with my coworkers and customers to improve the business as a whole. While working I attended the University of Washington and had the opportunity to take a java programming class, where my interest in computer science began. I am excited to take a challenging course load this year that will allow me to develop the needed skillset to pursue a career in software development.

I love analyzing and solving problems that involve critical thinking. Having these skills allowed to me be able to learn new skills and programming languages efficiently. I currently have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Microsoft Excel, and GitHub. Being able to make my own webpage and experiment with different properties in CSS is my new favorite pastime. I am also eager to learn more languages and principles to expand my knowledge about software development!
